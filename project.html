  <h3>  Project Description: </h3>
<p> The Cloud-Based Waste Management System using Dijkstra’s Algorithm is an intelligent, IoT-enabled solution designed to optimize the collection of municipal waste through efficient routing. The system leverages real-time data, cloud computing, and graph-based shortest path algorithms to enhance the performance and sustainability of urban waste collection.
</p> 
<h3>Objective: </h3>
<p>To develop a smart waste management system that:

Monitors waste bin status in real time.

Uses cloud infrastructure for centralized data management and access.

Applies Dijkstra’s Algorithm to determine the shortest and most efficient path for waste collection vehicles.

Minimizes fuel consumption, operational costs, and environmental impact. </p>

<h3>Key Features: </h3>
Smart Waste Bins:

Equipped with sensors (e.g., ultrasonic, infrared) to monitor fill levels.

Transmit data to the cloud in real time.

<h3>Cloud Integration: </h3>

Centralized platform for storing, processing, and analyzing bin status data.  <br>

Provides dashboards and mobile access for waste collection managers.  <br>

<h3>Route Optimization Using Dijkstra’s Algorithm:  </h3>

Constructs a graph of bin locations as nodes and roads as weighted edges (distance or time). <br>

Calculates the shortest path for collection vehicles to visit only full or nearly full bins.  <br>

Dynamically updates routes based on real-time data.  <br>

<h3>Web Interfaces: </h3> 

Interfaces for drivers to view optimal collection routes.  <br>

Admin panel for system monitoring and route planning.  <br>


<h3>Technologies Used: </h3>
IoT Devices: Arduino/Raspberry Pi, ultrasonic sensors. <br>

Cloud Platform: AWS / Google Cloud .  <br>

Backend: Node.js.  <br>

Frontend: React.js / Angular .  <br>

Database: MongoDB .  <br>

Algorithm: Dijkstra’s Algorithm   <br>
